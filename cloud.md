    Cloud computing is a relitively new field in computer science, yet everything being learned and done with the internet was ultimitly leading down to this. This is essentially becuase the **Cloud** is just the Internet with a snappy name. However, Cloud computing is an important topic in dristributed systems for many reasons. It helps solve a lot of problems in distributed systems in things like scalability, while implemeniting properties from distributed systems in their own systems. In this chapter we will go through general priniciples of cloud computing and what can be done with cloud computing. Afterwards, we will discuss popular cloud computing solutions being provided by Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. Lastly, there will be other things briefly mention at the end.

## **General**

---

  In essenece cloud computing is doing exactly what a computer and server does, except the services are across the internet. These services include but are not limited to proccesing, storage, software, intelligence, databases. All of this of course is done for a price, since most things unlike this book are not free. Yet even though it is not free that doesn't mean it is a bad thing since that means we can also make money off of it. This is also helpful for buisnesses since they don't always need to have their own servers to do something. Instead they can pay a company that runs a cloud service to do whatever they need done.[^1]

    -Speed
      - All most immediatly services are ready on domand, so whenever you need it its there
    - Cost
      - Cloud Computing is a lot cheaper then buying and setting up servers and storage
      - We don't have to spend money on electricity to power your servers
    - Scale
      - Completly elastic, so as a company grows its servers can grow in the cloud as needed
    - Productivity
      - We save time setting up the servers
    - Performance
      - Servers are kept up to date constantly that way the user always gets the best possible service
    - Security
      - Servers are protected by their own security meaning users have to spend less resources and money on security
